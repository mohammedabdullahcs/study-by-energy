# StudyByEnergy

## Project Description
StudyByEnergy is a minimal web app built to help undergraduate and graduate students study with emotional safety and clarity. Unlike typical productivity tools, StudyByEnergy treats rest as a first-class action, and encourages energy-based choices over pressure-driven hustle culture.

## Problem Statement
Productivity apps often foster guilt, anxiety, and pressure — with gamification, streaks, and language implying “not enough.” This fuels unhealthy study habits and burnout.

## Solution Overview
StudyByEnergy reimagines study sessions as a balance between focused tasks and intentional rest.
Key features:
- **Energy Check-In**: Students start by indicating their current energy.
- **Task Recommendation**: App suggests study or rest actions mindful of energy level.
- **Rest as Action**: Rest is never penalized; it’s offered as a valid choice.
- **Session Persistence**: Your choices persist across reloads.

## Technical Architecture
- **Frontend**: React (Vite SPA)
- **Styling**: CSS Modules/Tailwind
- **State**: LocalStorage for persistence
- **Commit Convention**: Feature-focused

## User Stories

- As a student, I receive gentle, context-aware recommendations.
- As a student, I can choose rest, study, or reflect without guilt.
